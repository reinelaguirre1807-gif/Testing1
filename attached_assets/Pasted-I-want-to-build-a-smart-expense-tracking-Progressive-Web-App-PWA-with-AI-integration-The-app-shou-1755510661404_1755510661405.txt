I want to build a smart expense tracking Progressive Web App (PWA) with AI integration. The app should feel modern, clean, and visually similar to YouTube Music’s UI, with support for both Light Mode (#FFFFFF) and Dark Mode (#000000).

🔑 Core Features

User Login System

Email + password authentication.

Store data securely per user.

Support multi-device sync for Pro users.

Dashboard (Layer-Based & Customizable)

Default layout includes:

Accounts (Cash, Debit, Credit, etc.)

Total Expenses

Graph (monthly/weekly trends)

Goals

Subscriptions

Users can reorder layers in Pro (e.g., move Graph above Accounts).

Accounts System (Customizable)

Users can rename accounts (e.g., “BDO Account,” “BPI Account,” “Cash,” etc.).

Users can specify currency (USD, PHP, etc.).

Users can add or delete accounts (Pro: unlimited, Free: 3 max).

Transaction Logging (AI-Powered in Pro)

AI parses natural language replies:

“Yes, I bought ice cream for $5 using cash” → logs as expense in Cash.

“I got $500, add it to my BDO account” → logs as income in BDO.

If an account doesn’t exist (e.g., “GCash”), the app should prompt to create it.

Free users must log expenses manually (no AI).

Push Notifications (Smart Reply)

Example: “Did you purchase something recently? Don’t forget to add it.”

Includes Reply button → user can reply directly from notification.

AI (Pro only) extracts data (amount, category, payment method, income/expense) and updates balance automatically.

Insights & Reports (Pro Only)

AI-generated monthly/weekly summaries.

Notifications like “You spent $100 more this month than last.”

Predictive insights: “You’re on track to overspend on food this month.”

Category breakdowns and advanced charts.

Subscription Tracking

Detect recurring expenses (Netflix, Spotify, etc.).

Remind users before renewal.

Budget Goals (Pro)

Users can set category limits (e.g., $200 for food).

AI notifies them when close to the limit.

Account Transfers (Pro)

Example: “Transfer $100 from Cash to BDO.”
